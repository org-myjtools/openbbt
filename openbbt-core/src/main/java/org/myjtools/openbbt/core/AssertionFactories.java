 * Registry that groups multiple {@link AssertionFactory} instances and allows lookup by name.

 * // Use the pre-configured core factories
 * AssertionFactories factories = AssertionFactories.CORE_ENGLISH;
 * AssertionFactory<?> numberFactory = factories.byName("number-assertion");
 *
 * // Or create a custom registry
 * AssertionFactories custom = AssertionFactories.of(
